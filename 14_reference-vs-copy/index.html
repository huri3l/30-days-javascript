    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // one way

    //  <!-- ? Ways to COPY arrays -->
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    const team4 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
